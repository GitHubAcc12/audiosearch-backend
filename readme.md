### TODOs
- ERROR HANDLING
    - Certain user inputs might crash the server in its current state
- Delete workers after some time of not being used
    - Otherwise they will sit there with all the data and it will cost a lot of money
- Cleaning up/Refactoring
- Upload of all the small files uses the most time:
    - check if its faster to upload one big file
